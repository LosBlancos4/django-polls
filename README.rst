    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'polls',
    ]

2. Include the following URLconfs in your project urls.py like this::

    path('login/', LoginView.as_view(template_name='polls/login.html')),
	path('logout/', LogoutView.as_view(next_page='/')),
    path('<int:question_id>/logout/', LogoutView.as_view(next_page='/')),
    path('<int:question_id>/vote/logout/', LogoutView.as_view(next_page='/')),
    path('', include('polls.urls'))

    Note! Add the following methods in the module:
        from django.urls import include, path
        from django.contrib.auth.views import LoginView, LogoutView
